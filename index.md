### New General Safety Regulation (GSR) published as 2019/2144 (3/4)

Consequences of the new *GSR 2019/2144*:

1. New UN ECE Regulations on Components Introduced
2. New UN ECE Regulations on Occupant Protection Introduced
3. Scope of Existing UN ECE Regulations Expanded
4. New Features Requiring New Regulatory Requirements to be Developed

### New General Safety Regulation (GSR) published as 2019/2144 (4/4)

A lot of additional safety components need to be installed on newly developed vehicles .red[starting 2022] (detailed in many Regulations). Relevant examples:

.pull-left[
* Advanced emergency braking systems (AEBS) capable of detecting vehicles, stationary obstacles, pedestrians and cyclists
* Revering cameras
* Emergency lane keeping systems
* Alcohol interlock
* Driver drowsiness and attention detection systems
]

.pull-right[
* .red[Protection against cyber-attacks]
* Driver availability monitoring systems
* Systems to replace the driverâ€™s control
* Systems to monitor the area surrounding the vehicle
* Systems to provide safety information to other road users
* Communication systems and protocols for platooning

### Detailed regulations for protection against cyber-attacks (1/2)

Among the regulations .red[effective 4/2022] thanks to the new *GSR 2019/2144* are very detailed Cyber Security enforcing guidelines.

* R155: Proposal for a new UN Regulation on uniform provisions concerning the approval of vehicles with regards to cyber security and cyber security management system
* R156: Proposal for a new UN Regulation on uniform provisions concerning the approval of vehicles with regards to software update and software updates management system

### Detailed regulations for protection against cyber-attacks (2/2)

* R155 and R156 consider the full lifecycle of a vehicle from the cyber security point of view
* the *process* and not the *algorithms* or *implementations* is taken into account (similar to Functional Safty)
* ISO 26262-2018 (functional safety), ISO/PAS 21448 (safety of the intended functionality) and .red[ISO/SAE 21434] (cybersecurity engineering) are explicitly recalled
* ISO/SAE 21434 is the brand new approach to cybersecurity engineering for vehicles, closely resembling ISO 26262-2018
